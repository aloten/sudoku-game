# sudoku-game
An interactive sudoku puzzle you can play in your web browser

Before I made this web brower game in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, I created a sudoku puzzle solver in Java in my Data Structures class in Spring 2021.

I then translated the algorithm into JavaScript and created an interactive web program. It is currently on my website aloten.github.io.

All you need to see the result is to download sudoku.html (which already contains the javascript file sudoku.js) and sudokuStyle.css on the same folder level and run sudoku.html in your web browser (in case there are any browser errors, use Chrome).

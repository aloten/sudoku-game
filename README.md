# sudoku-game
An interactive sudoku puzzle you can play in your web browser

Before I made this web brower game in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, I created a sudoku puzzle solver in Java in my Data Structures class in Spring 2021.

I then translated the algorithm into JavaScript and created an interactive web program. It is currently on my website aloten.github.io
